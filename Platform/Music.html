        <p>The 1975's <b>Notes on a Conditional Form</b> is a genre-defying album that explores identity, 
        memory, and the human condition. The album is full of cameos, including Greta Thunberg 
        and Cutty Ranks, and is considered the band's most eccentric album.<b>Matty Healy</b> also described the album as 
		a “more intimate, nocturnal and cinematic” record than<b> ABIIOR.</b> During his NME interview, Healy also shared that the album 
		<b>“is very homely, it’s a lot about home, it’s a lot about mental health, it’s a lot about domesticity.”</b></p>
